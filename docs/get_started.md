# Get started


## Git branching model

We will follow this branching model for Git, so please **read this document carefully and make sure you understand it**:

## Utils

1. Install [Editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/#download) for your text editor of choice (scroll down to find your editor). This will make code formatting easier across devices.
2. Install Blade (Laravel templating engine) support for your text editor
	- Link for Sublime Text: https://github.com/Medalink/laravel-blade
3. Install Sass support for your text editor
	- Link for Sublime Text: https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sass


## Laravel

1. Get to know the directory structure:  https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/structure
	- If you prefer a **video** (recommended): https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/9
2. Read about [what a database migration is](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/migrations) (if you don't know already)

### If you're developing front-end

- Read the Frontend section of the Laravel docs (everything except localization):
	- https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/blade (**this will let you know how to build templates for Laravel**)
	- https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/frontend
	- https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mix

- (Optional) Watch this tutorial: https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018/episodes/34

## Reference

If you like videos, you can watch this series (or parts of it) to know how Laravel works and how to build an app. It's super easy to follow and Jeffrey Way is one of the original developers of the framework.
